## Zsh & Oh My Zsh Installation

[Zsh Installation Guide](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)<br>
[Oh My Zsh Installation Guide](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation)

```shell
# Install Zsh
# For Mac
brew install zsh
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install zsh
# For SUSE Linux
sudo zypper install zsh

# Change zsh as the default shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)

# Install Oh My Zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Install Fonts

Oh My Zsh (especially with a theme like [Powerlevel10k]) requires font with specific font ligature & icons.

I'm currently using [JetBrains Mono] for my dev. environment.
To be exact, patched version from the [Nerd Font]. They are not that differ in standard use-cases,
but powerlevel10k does require some of glyphs (icons) that [Nerd Font] provides.<br>
I highly suggest downloading both official & nerd font patched versions and use the official one as a fallback.

[JetBrains Mono]: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/
[Nerd Font]: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

```shell
# For Mac
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
# JetBrains Nerd Font Mono
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
# JetBrains Mono
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono

# For Window
# Manually download the font & unzip + install the font
# JetBrains Nerd Font Mono
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/JetBrainsMono.zip
# JetBrains Mono
https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/releases/latest

# For Linux
# JetBrains Mono
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/master/install_manual.sh)"
# It's a bit trickier for Linux to install/patch Nerd Font... Please check Nerd Font repo for more information.
```

Append `JetBrains Mono` after the `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono` to the font-family setting of your choice of IDE or
Terminal.

```default
"fontFamily": "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono", "JetBrains Mono",
```

## Install Theme

Install the theme that you want. I personally moved from [Pure theme] to [Powerlevel10k].
(AFAIK, [Powerlevel10k] is [faster](https://gist.github.com/romkatv/7cbab80dcbc639003066bb68b9ae0bbf) than [Pure theme]
and supports various options to personalize look & functions)

[pure theme]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure
[Powerlevel10k]: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k

### Powerlevel10k

> [Powerlevel10k] is a theme for Zsh. It emphasizes speed, flexibility and out-of-the-box experience.

Check [get started](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#get-started) to find your best installation option.

1. Clone this repository in oh-my-zsh's themes directory:

   ```shell
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
   ```

2. Set `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in `~/.zshrc`.

## OMZ Plugins

Any extension with :pushpin: attached are things that you **MUST INSTALL** for a better life.

### autoupdate :pushpin:

You may adjust how often omz checks for the update by adjusting the below line from the `~/.zshrc` file.<br>
