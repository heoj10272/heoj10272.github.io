We need to use `&str` to accept items like `"milk"`.

```rust
/* file: "exercises/generics/generics1.rs" */
fn main() {
    let mut shopping_list: Vec<&str> = Vec::new();
    shopping_list.push("milk");
}
```

## generics2.rs

Using generic types [in method definition] is not that complicated. We usually use one letter (most
preferably `T`) for a generic type.

```rust
/* file: "exercises/generics/generics2.rs" */
struct Wrapper<T> {
    value: T,
}

impl<T> Wrapper<T> {
    pub fn new(value: T) -> Self {
        Wrapper { value }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn store_u32_in_wrapper() {
        assert_eq!(Wrapper::new(42).value, 42);
    }

    #[test]
    fn store_str_in_wrapper() {
        assert_eq!(Wrapper::new("Foo").value, "Foo");
    }
}
```

To me, Rust's [bounds] felt like a new concept, yet a very powerful tool. Bounding restricts the generic to
types that conform to the bounds. So we can assume the generic type can perform based on the bounding
traits. And we have to implement a trait for the types that we want to be used as a generic type.

The one thing you have to keep in mind is that you have to know common `Traits` that Rust provides.
This [blog post] gives you a tour of the most common `Traits` that you will see.

let's get back to the exercise, we want to *print* the `ReportCard`. This can be done by trait
[`Display`]. `String` & `u8` already implements `Display`. But `grade`, is generic type variable.
So we want to *enforce* that generic type to implement the trait `Display`.

```rust
pub struct ReportCard<T: std::fmt::Display> {
    pub grade: T,
    pub student_name: String,
    pub student_age: u8,
}
```

By using `<T: std::fmt::Display>`, we are telling the compiler that I will accept any kind of type as
`T` as long as it implements trait `Display`. Sounds good!

Now `grade` can be *displayed* as we want. We can use [`format!`] macro to print `ReportCard`.

```rust
impl<T: std::fmt::Display> ReportCard<T> {
    pub fn print(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            "{} ({}) - achieved a grade of {}",
            &self.student_name, &self.student_age, &self.grade
        )
    }
}
```

After all modification, the whole code looks like follow:

```rust
/* file: "exercises/generics/generics3.rs" */
pub struct ReportCard<T: std::fmt::Display> {
    pub grade: T,
    pub student_name: String,
    pub student_age: u8,
}

impl<T: std::fmt::Display> ReportCard<T> {
    pub fn print(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            "{} ({}) - achieved a grade of {}",
            &self.student_name, &self.student_age, &self.grade
        )
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn generate_numeric_report_card() {
        let report_card = ReportCard {
            grade: 2.1,
            student_name: "Tom Wriggle".to_string(),
            student_age: 12,
        };
        assert_eq!(
            report_card.print(),
            "Tom Wriggle (12) - achieved a grade of 2.1"
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn generate_alphabetic_report_card() {
        let report_card = ReportCard {
            grade: "A+",
            student_name: "Gary Plotter".to_string(),
            student_age: 11,
        };
        assert_eq!(
            report_card.print(),
            "Gary Plotter (11) - achieved a grade of A+"
        );
    }
}
```
