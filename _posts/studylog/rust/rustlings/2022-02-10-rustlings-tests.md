> [Tests] are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner.
> The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:
>
> 1. Set up any needed data or state.
> 2. Run the code you want to test.
> 3. Assert the results are what you expect.
>
> Letâ€™s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that take these actions,
> which include the test attribute, a few macros, and the should_panic attribute.
